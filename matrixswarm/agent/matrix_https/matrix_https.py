class Agent(BootAgent):
    """
    The Matrix HTTPS Agent, a specialized BootAgent for secure,
    packet-based communication over HTTPS.

    This agent extends the core functionality of a BootAgent with a Flask-based
    HTTPS server. It is designed to act as a secure ingress point for
    external commands, enforcing multiple layers of authentication, including
    mutual TLS (mTLS) with SPKI pin verification and a cryptographic signature
    check on the packet payload.

    It also includes endpoints to trap and log unauthorized access attempts.

    Attributes:
        AGENT_VERSION (str): The version of the agent.
        app (Flask.app): The Flask application instance that runs the HTTPS server.
        port (int): The network port the server listens on.
        allowlist_ips (list): A list of IP addresses permitted to access the server.
        payload_dir (str): The filesystem path for storing incoming packet payloads.
        cert_pem (str): The agent's TLS certificate in PEM format.
        key_pem (str): The agent's private key in PEM format.
        ca_pem (str): The PEM-encoded CA root certificate for client verification.
        local_spki (str): The SHA-256 SPKI fingerprint of the agent's server cert.
        expected_peer_spki (str): The expected SPKI pin of the connecting client.
        peer_pub_key (Crypto.PublicKey.RSA): The public key used to verify
            signatures on incoming packets.
        run_server_retries (bool): A flag to control server restart attempts.
        _emit_process_beacon (function): A beacon function to signal process liveness.
        _emit_beacon (function): A beacon function to signal service liveness.

    Methods:
        pre_boot():
            Initializes and starts the HTTPS server thread before the main
            agent loops begin.

        post_boot():
            Logs a message indicating the agent is fully operational.

        process_command(data):
            A placeholder method for processing delegated commands.

        worker_pre():
            A hook that runs once before the main worker loop.

        service_monitor():
            Continuously pings the local server to verify the health of the
            HTTPS stack, emitting a liveness beacon on success.

        worker_post():
            A hook that runs once after the main worker loop exits.

        configure_routes():
            Sets up all Flask routes for the server, including the main
            `/matrix` endpoint, and various trap/denial endpoints.

        receive_command():
            The main POST handler for the `/matrix` endpoint. It performs
            a multi-step security check on incoming requests:
            1.  IP allowlist verification.
            2.  Mutual TLS SPKI pin verification.
            3.  JSON payload parsing and size guard.
            4.  Timestamp-based replay attack prevention.
            5.  Cryptographic signature verification on the payload.
            If all checks pass, the packet is relayed to the core Matrix agent.

        deny_unsupported_methods():
            A handler that traps and logs requests using unsupported HTTP
            methods on the `/matrix` endpoint.

        trap_scan_targets():
            A handler for decoy endpoints that logs and denies requests to
            common attack targets like `/robots.txt` or `/wp-login.php`.

        make_spoof_response():
            Generates a deceptive HTML response to mislead automated scanners.

        shutdown_cleanup():
            Deletes temporary certificate files created during server startup.

        run_server():
            Initializes and runs the HTTPS server with mutual TLS, handling
            potential startup failures with retries.

        """
