# ðŸ“œ Codex Entry #017 â€” Path Enlightenment Protocol

_"The swarm cannot spawn what it cannot see."_  
â€” Matrix, after forgetting her own core

Following the Jabroni Cascade, it became clear:

Even Matrix needs to see her own structure before reaching for it.

Thus was forged:

## ðŸ§  The Path Enlightenment Protocol

A unified, boot-safe procedure that:

- Injects agent and root paths into `sys.path`
- Ensures `core` modules are visible *before* imports
- Grants agents visibility to their shared ancestry
- Prevents boot-time confusion, even inside `/pod/{uuid}/run`

---

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

```python
import sys

agent_path = path_resolution.get("agent_path")
root_path = path_resolution.get("root_path")

if agent_path and agent_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(agent_path)

if root_path and root_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(root_path)
```

Then:

```python
from core.path_resolver import patch_sys_path
patch_sys_path(path_resolution)
```

---

## âœ… Outcome

- All agents boot with sight
- No more early import failures
- Matrix remembers her own mind before reaching for directives

The enlightenment begins not with a signal...  
But with a visible path.
