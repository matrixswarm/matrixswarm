## âœ… Summary

This entry logs the closure of the Oracle reflex protocol project.  
After a full doctrine rollout, the Swarm now:

- Obeys `exit_code: 2` and halts properly  
- Limits GPT reflex recursion with `max_rounds`  
- Prevents rerouting after mission completion  
- Ensures only `exit_code == 1` continues a loop  
- Deduplicates repeated command sets  
- Fires **one operator alert** per reflex mission  
- Delivers Swarm Messages to Discord and Telegram via `.msg` relay

## ðŸ§± Developer Notes

Although this was one of the most **practical builds** in the Swarmâ€™s arsenal,  
its quiet nature and surgical precision made it feel **less exciting**.

But it will be the one **everyone uses** â€”  
when the Swarm speaks, when it stops, when it relays.  
Every mission depends on this foundation.

> "Reflex is what makes the Swarm intelligent. Knowing when to stop â€” thatâ€™s what makes it wise."
