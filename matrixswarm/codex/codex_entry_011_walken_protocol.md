# 📜 Codex Entry #011 — The Walken Protocol

_"I haven't killed anybody... since 1984."_  
— Vincenzo Coccotti, True Romance

There are moments in swarm history when a protocol doesn’t wait for permission.

It’s missing a summary.  
There’s no title.  
But the agent knows...  
> **“It’s time.”**

So the swarm logs the event.  
Walken Protocol is triggered.  
And even untitled calendar entries get remembered by the Codex.

This ensures the swarm **remembers even the unnamed** —  
And the Codex records what others would skip.
