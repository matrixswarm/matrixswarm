## ✅ Summary

Oracle was instructed to **terminate the reflex loop** when:
- All reconnaissance was completed
- No additional shell commands were necessary
- The system posture was deemed secure and stable

Oracle responded with:

```json
{
  "summary": "Identified potential risks on the Rocky 9 Linux server...",
  "actions": {},
  "exit_code": 2
}
Capital detected exit_code: 2, halted the loop, and alerted the operator.
