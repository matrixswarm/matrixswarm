# 🧠 Operation Reflex Loop Alpha

**📅 Timestamp:** `2025-05-19 03:26Z`  
**🛰 Mission ID:** `blackhole-cometh`  
**🎯 Objective:** Autonomous posture analysis on Apache, MySQL, Redis (Rocky 9)

---

## ✅ Summary

- First successful reflex loop executed through Capital ↔ Oracle
- Chain of command included shell reconnaissance, GPT-based analysis, iterative command refinement
- Oracle self-corrected based on system state and logs
- Capital executed commands and returned system telemetry without breaking loop logic

---

## 🧪 Sequence

1. **Prompt to Oracle:** Initiated system posture analysis  
2. **Oracle Reflex #1:** Initial probes (`ps`, `netstat`, `systemctl`)  
3. **Capital Execution:** Commands executed and results gathered  
4. **Oracle Reflex #2+:**  
   - Detected Apache access errors  
   - Diagnosed Redis/MySQL binding  
   - Flagged timeout misconfigs  
   - Proposed file permission changes  
   - Reconfirmed changes  
5. **Exit Code:** Sustained at `1` (follow-up) to loop through analysis  
6. **Parse integrity:** Maintained — no malformed JSON or GPT trail-off  
7. **Loop Depth:** 7+ cycles

---

## 🪓 Tactical Notes

- Oracle identified dangerous reflex escalation (`sudo chown`) — will require permission gating in future iterations
- Capital validated all command outputs against shell-safe parser
- Codex chain logged at every stage

## 🔁 Reflex Commands

Examples from Oracle:
```bash
ps aux | grep apache
netstat -tuln
grep 'bind-address' /etc/my.cnf
systemctl status httpd
ls -la /var/www/html
