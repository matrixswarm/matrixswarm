MatrixSwarm Relay Protocol v1.1
===============================

Release Date: 2025-05-07
Signed By: MatrixSwarm Core (General + GPT)
Commit Type: Feature Upgrade
Version: 1.1

Summary:
--------
Relay Protocol v1.1 introduces modular, factory-driven message relays for MatrixSwarm agents.
This upgrade enables agents like `telegram-relay-1` and `discord-relay-1` to dispatch alerts
via `.msg` payloads using entirely decoupled factory logic.

Features:
---------
- 🧠 `config["factories"]` injection now supported natively
- 🧹 Reserved keys (`bot_token`, `chat_id`, `role`, etc.) are no longer interpreted as factories
- ⚡ Modular `alert.subscriber` factory available for Telegram and Discord
- 📦 Self-creating inbox structure per agent (e.g. `incoming/alarm_listener/critical`)
- 🧵 Named reflex threads with full lifecycle sync to `agent.running`
- 📡 Real-world tested with manual `.msg` injection and live alerts to Telegram + Discord
- 🖼 Codex screenshot included (Telegram alert received in field)
- 🏷 Timestamp-ready and OTS verified

---------------
- `telegram-relay-1`

Factory Injected:
