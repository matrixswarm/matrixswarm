## 🔐 Memory Shard Protocol v1.0

- `ServiceRegistryAgent` now handles `cmd_resolve()` with swarm-safe logic
- Verifies `reply_to` path exists before writing (phantom-prevention)
- Multi-universe safe: writes only to active `/matrix/{universe}/comm/...`
- No dead-letter files or unauthorized folder creation
- Output confirmed at:  
  `/matrix/ai/latest/comm/commander-1/stack/resolve_oracle_test.json`

## 🔧 Agent Updates

### ✅ `ServiceRegistryAgent`
- Respects `comm_path_resolved` for multi-universe ops
- Resolves roles using the current swarm tree
- Drops replies only if the receiver’s path exists

### ✅ `MatrixAgent`
- Confirmed: broadcast, replace_agent, heartbeat, route_payload
- `TreeParser.all_universal_ids()` now drives universal broadcast targeting
- GUI dropdown “broadcast” works swarm-wide

## 📡 YConn Draft: How We Taught the Swarm to Remember

> MatrixSwarm is no longer just autonomous.  
> It remembers.

- We deployed a memory shard protocol that lets any agent resolve role-based commands across the hive — without hardcoded paths.
- It checks the file system before every write.
- No phantom directories. No ghost files. No fake life.
