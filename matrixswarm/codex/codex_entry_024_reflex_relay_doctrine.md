# 🧠 Codex Entry 024: Reflex Relay Doctrine

**📅 Timestamp:** `2025-05-19 05:00:00Z`  
**🛰 Mission ID:** `blackhole-cometh`  
**🔔 Relay Type:** Decoupled Messaging via `.msg` Drop  
**📡 Roles:** `comm`  
**📁 Targets:** `telegram-bot-father`, `discord-delta`

---

## ✅ Summary

Reflex alerts are now fully decoupled from their delivery agents.  
Capital no longer needs to know **how** a message is delivered — only **who** will receive it.

This is reflex doctrine for real-world swarms:
- Drop once ✅
- Delivered many ✅
- Format agnostic ✅

---

## 🧩 Core Mechanism

Reflex alerts are dropped to:
/comm/<comm-agent-uid>/incoming/<level>/

Edit

Each `comm` agent (e.g. Telegram, Discord) listens to the levels it subscribes to (e.g., `["critical", "warning"]`), parses the `.msg` payload, and handles dispatch.

## 🔧 Payload Format

```json
{
  "universal_id": "capital_gpt",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-19 05:00:00",
  "level": "critical",
  "msg": "Reflex loop terminated (exit_code = 3)",
  "cause": "GPT failed to resolve telemetry"
}
⚙️ Roles in Play
Role	Description
comm	Any agent that accepts reflex messages and relays to the outside world
alert.subscriber	Factory config that enables role inbox and dispatch logic
drop_reflex_alert()	Utility function that writes .msg to all applicable comm nodes

🧠 Outcome
Capital and Oracle can now:

Signal swarm relays

Deliver to multiple endpoints without knowing their logic

Enforce role = comm → location = /incoming/<level>/ reflex standard
