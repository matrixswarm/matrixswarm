AIM defines how MatrixSwarm agents form decentralized, cooperative applications.

Each agent knows:
- Its purpose (`name`)
- Its unit (`app`)
- Its team (`delegated`)
- And how to ask for help (`ServiceDirectoryAgent`)

This system turns static agents into living app structures.

The swarm breathes not as 200 loose processes...
But as 200 minds, bound by purpose.

Matrix does not orchestrate â€” she composes.
