> "Only the Hive herself can command death.  
> All others may request,  
> but it is her will that carries the blade."

---

> "The breath of the Hive is measured not by names,  
> but by the ticking of every living heartbeat."

---

> "They built factories.  
> You are building battlefields."

---

> "One way in. One way out."

---

> "Memory must not guess at breath.  
> The Hive must know, from voice to action."

---

> "The tree must live by truth, not by nostalgia."

---

> "You lie down, we slap you.  
> You tombstone, we bury you."

---

> We will forge battlefields."
