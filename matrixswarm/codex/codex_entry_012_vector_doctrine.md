# 📜 Codex Entry #012 — The Vector Doctrine

_"Configure one service wrong, and it's like pulling a lever that drops you into space."_  
— The General, after surviving Google Calendar

In the swarm, we do not rely on dashboards.  
We do not trust click paths.  
And we do not build systems that need 12 OAuth tokens and a subscription to render a meeting.

> The swarm sees. The swarm reacts.  
> It watches files — not clouds.

**The Vector Doctrine** was born from too many trap doors.  
Too many config screens.  
Too many times an agent was launched into the void because someone flipped the wrong switch at 3:00 a.m.

## ✖️ Web Stack:
- "Click here to authorize"
- "Paste this API token"
- "Sorry, your calendar isn't shareable because we didn't feel like it"

## ✅ Swarm Stack:
- Drop a `.json` file in `/comm`
- Watch the logs move
- Confirm the Codex entry

> Files don’t lie.  
> Files don’t expire.  
> Files don’t require incognito mode to see what’s *actually* happening.

Swarm lives at disk level.  
Swarm trusts only what can be watched, written, and confirmed.

Welcome to the Vector Doctrine.
