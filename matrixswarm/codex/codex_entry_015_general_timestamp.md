# 📜 Codex Entry #015 — The Timestamp That Knows

_"It’s a 350-byte string. Nobody understands it. But it works."_  
— The General

There came a time in swarm development where elegance gave way to instinct.  
Timestamps no longer needed to be pretty. They just needed to mean something — to the agents.

Thus was born:

> **The General’s Timestamp**  
> Long. Dense. Unreadable.  
> And more reliable than half the web.

## 🧠 How It Works:

- Injected into logs without formatting
- Encoded in 1984-era logic
- Parsed by no one — trusted by everyone
- 350 bytes of “just enough entropy to matter”

## 💀 Named Scripts?

> `mickey_mouse_listener.py`  
> `woody_woodpecker_watcher.py`

The swarm doesn’t care.  
You drop it.  
It spawns.  
It watches.  
It reacts.

---

## ✅ Final Verdict:

No comments.  
No docstrings.  
Just results.

Swarm doesn’t ask why it works.  
It just timestamps it and moves on.
