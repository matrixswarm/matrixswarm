[CORE] Broadcast Protocol v1.0 + Heartbeat + ReplaceAgent + Safety Init

🧠 MatrixSwarm Core Update — May 6, 2025

🔹 Implemented Broadcast Protocol v1.0:
  - Matrix now routes `route_payload` to `/comm/{agent}/broadcast/`
  - `TreeParser.all_universal_ids()` powers target resolution
  - Matrix self-exclusion by default (opt-in via `include_matrix=True`)
  - `BroadcastListenerMixin` added for agents to handle `on_broadcast_{command}`

🔹 Upgraded TreeParser:
  - Added: `walk_tree()`, `has_node()`, `get_node()`, `all_universal_ids(include_matrix=False)`

🔹 Agent Replacement Protocol:
  - Fixed `replace_agent` handler (was missing `elif`)
  - Reaper sends `.die`, Scavenger confirms, Matrix respawns clean
  - Hot-swap successful with Codex logging and heartbeat continuity

🔹 Heartbeat Protocol v1.1 (Single File Model):
  - Agents now touch `hello.moto/last.ping` with their `install_name`
  - Matrix and Commander read `mtime` for uptime checks
  - Removed need for pruning logic and heartbeat folder sweeps

🔹 Boot Safety Protocol v1.0:
  - Added `ensure_comm_dirs()` function
  - Called from `BootAgent.worker_pre()` and Oracle on init
  - Guarantees critical folders exist on all spawn scenarios

🧾 CodexDossier.md updated with:
  - Heartbeat v1.1
  - Broadcast v1.0
  - Agent Replacement Protocol
  - Default comm structure

🔐 Memory Shard Protocol v1.0 (Appended to May 6 Core Commit)
🧠 MatrixSwarm Core Update — May 6, 2025 (Extended)

🔹 Memory Shard Protocol v1.0:

ServiceRegistryAgent now writes resolution responses only to verified, existing paths

Introduced phantom-prevention check:

if not os.path.exists(os.path.dirname(reply_path)): return
Ensures no dead-letter folders are created

Guarantees universe-specific path alignment (/matrix/{universe}/comm/...)

Resolves agent roles by name and returns live results via cmd_resolve

GUI or manual .cmd injection now safe across all universes

🔹 Codex Log Confirmation:

resolve_oracle_test.json landed in commander-1/stack/

Logged as: /codex/memory_shards/resolve_confirmed_oracle.json

1 match returned: oracle-1

🔹 Swarm Rule Logged:

"No agent shall write to a folder unless it exists in full. No reply, no shard, no whisper unless the path lives first."


This commit locks in tactical swarm control, safe spawning, and dynamic agent interaction across the hive. Fully battle-tested.
