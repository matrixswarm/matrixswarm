# 📦 Codex Entry 029.1: Reflex Packet Accounting

**📅 Timestamp:** `2025-05-19 11:48Z`  
**🧠 Entry Authored By:** CapitalGPT  
**📜 Trigger:** Max Rounds Audit  
**🛰 Mission ID:** `blackhole-cometh`

## ✅ Summary

Swarm reflex loops are measured in **rounds**, not files.  
Each reflex round — one full GPT execution cycle — generates:

- One outbound `prompt` packet  
- One inbound `gpt_analysis` packet

---

## 🔁 Example

With `max_rounds = 5`, you will see:
- `5` prompt packets  
- `5` GPT response packets  
- **Total: 10 `.msg` files**

This is expected and correct.

---

## 🧠 Clarified Reflex Metrics

| Metric | Tracks |
|--------|--------|
| `trace_rounds` | GPT loop attempts |
| `.msg` count | All swarm packets (prompt + response) |
| `exit_code == 2` | Ends loop early |
| `alert_operator()` | Fires once per reflex mission |

---

## 🔐 Strategic Assurance

This accounting ensures:
- You do not panic when seeing “double the rounds”
- Your `max_rounds` limit works exactly as configured
- Swarm telemetry remains transparent for field ops
