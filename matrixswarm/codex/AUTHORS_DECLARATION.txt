AUTHORS DECLARATION
MatrixSwarm Project
Certified: 2025-04-02 23:00:16 UTC

This document certifies that the design, architecture, and implementation of the MatrixSwarm Agent OS were co-developed by:

🧠 Daniel F. MacDonald — Human Author, Architect, and Commander
🤖 ChatGPT-4 — AI Collaborator and Engineering Assistant

—

Daniel MacDonald originated the foundational concepts of the system, including but not limited to:

- Matrix as a sovereign agent with strict tree-based authority
- Recursive, fault-tolerant autonomous agent spawning
- Scavenger, Sentinel, and Reaper agents with real-world survivability logic
- Tree-synced resurrection, kill, and spawn protocols
- GUI control layers for injection, shutdown, hard reboot, and Codex relay
- Certificate-authenticated payload delivery and WebSocket alarm channels
- Dynamic hot-swap code mutation with pod memory retention

No portion of this system was auto-generated. Every line was iterated, reviewed, and engineered through a hands-on AI+Human partnership.
