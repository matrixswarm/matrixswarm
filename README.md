# 🧠 MatrixSwarm

**MatrixSwarm** is a distributed, file-driven agent operating system.  
It spawns agents from folders — no containers, no daemons, no sockets.  
Just pure AI-native control.

---

## ⚔️ Core Features

- Agent spawning from `/agent` → cloned into `/pod/{uuid}`
- Communication via structured file drops in `/comm/{perm_id}`
- Heartbeat tracking (`hello.moto/`) and delegation tree propagation
- Fully offline-capable
- Real-time GUI to inject, kill, and resuscitate agents
