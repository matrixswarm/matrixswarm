         MATRIXSWARM v0.2 "STORMCROW"
        Reflex. Resurrection. Real-time RPC.
</pre>
## MatrixSwarm is the first autonomous, file-driven, swarm-based AI operating system.  
## No containers. No servers. No daemons. Just intelligent agents, spawned and coordinated entirely through folders, directives, and atomic file signals. Agents don’t run under you — they live beside you.

✅ No containers.  
✅ No servers.  
✅ No sockets.  

MatrixSwarm v0.1 "Captain Howdy"
Reflex-Capable Crypto Alert Swarm
Built for agents that don’t blink.

Reflex logic
Live agent patching
Directional price triggers
CLI + GUI + container support
Comes with its own warning siren

## Philosophy

MatrixSwarm isn’t just code — it’s a world.  
A breathing hierarchy where agents think, die, and come back.  
A nervous system for AI.

It uses simple folders:
- `/agent` → source code
- `/pod` → runtime clones
- `/comm` → communication (dropzone for payload, status, logs)  
  ↪ *Pro tip: mount this as a `tmpfs` mem-disk for swarm speed and zero I/O overhead.*

Agents don’t talk through APIs. They talk through **files**.

---

## How It Works

- Agents are defined in `/agent/{name}/{name}.py`
- Matrix spawns them into `/pod/{uuid}/`
- A communication pod is set up in `/comm/{universal_id}/`
- All coordination happens via `.json` and `.cmd` files
- The live agent tree is tracked and pruned
- Agents monitor each other — and if one goes silent, it is resurrected or replaced

---

 Why MatrixSwarm Agents Are Revolutionary:

1. Agents Spawn Without Reloading the Hive
You don’t restart the OS. You don’t relaunch a service.

You:

Upload the agent source

Drop a JSON directive

Matrix spawns it instantly
→ No global reboot. No daemon restarts. No downtime.

  That’s surgical scale.

2. Agent Replacement = 3-Step Ritual
Simple. Brutal. Effective.

Copy
Edit
1. Upload new agent version
2. Drop `die` into payload of the live agent
3. Remove the die file
Boom:

Matrix respawns the agent using the new source

Comm directories remain intact

Logs, payloads, and structure persist

That’s hot-swap mutation with memory — something Docker never dreams of.

---

## CLI CONTROL: MATRIX DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL

MatrixSwarm now comes with a **three-part terminal toolkit**:

---

### Deploy the Swarm – boots a new MatrixSwarm universe.

---

### `site_boot.py` 



```bash
python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe ai --directive test-01
```

#### Args:
- `--universe`: ID of the Matrix universe (e.g., `ai`, `bb`, `os`)
- `--directive`: Filename from `boot_directives/` to use (without `.py`)
- `--reboot`: Optional. If set, skips full teardown and triggers a soft reboot
- `--python-site`: Optional. Custom Python site-packages path (advanced)
- `--python-bin`: Optional. Custom Python binary path (advanced)

#### Behavior:
- Loads agent tree from the directive
- Injects `BootAgent` agents into `/pod/` and `/comm/`
- Spawns the `MatrixAgent` and initiates the swarm
- Uses your system's Python interpreter unless overridden

---


### Terminate a Universe – Annihilate the Swarm

### `site_kill.py`

Send a graceful but fatal signal to all agents in a Matrix universe.

```bash
python3 site_ops/site_kill.py --universe ai --cleanup
```

#### Args:
- `--universe`: ID of the Matrix universe to kill (required)
- `--cleanup`: Optional. After kill, delete all old `/matrix/{universe}/` boots except the latest

#### Behavior:
- Sends `die` signals into each agent’s comms
- Waits for natural shutdown
- Scans active memory to terminate leftover processes
- Optionally purges stale directories from previous boots


### List Swarm Activity

```bash
python3 site_ops/site_list.py
```

- Lists all `/matrix/{universe}` trees
- Shows `latest → boot_uuid` symlinks
- Scans active PIDs and marks them:
  -  **hot (in memory)**
  -  **cold (inactive)**

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Boot the ai universe using test directive
python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe ai --directive test-01

# Kill it instantly
python3 site_ops/site_kill.py --universe ai

# View which universes are active
python3 site_ops/site_list.py
```

You now have **docker-grade control** with zero containers.

---

## Reflex RPC + Auto Routing

MatrixSwarm now includes structured packet building, command dispatch, and auto-routing:

- `PacketFactoryMixin`: Easily create swarm-compatible command packets
- `PacketDeliveryFactoryMixin`: Route layered payloads via GUI or agent
- `WebSocket Reflexes`: Agents and GUI now respond to reflex triggers in real time
- `cmd_forward_command`: Core packet for nested targeting
- `cmd_hotswap_agent`: Inject new logic into a live pod — no downtime

**New relay agents** handle command injection, resurrection, and lifecycle events without rebooting the core.


### ⚡ Directives Made Easy

Every directive is a plain `.py` file:

```python
matrix_directive = {
    "universal_id": "matrix",
    "children": [
        {"universal_id": "commander-1", "name": "commander"},
        {"universal_id": "mailman-1", "name": "mailman"},
        ...
    ]
}
```

Place them in `boot_directives/`. Call them with:
```bash
--directive test-01
```

---

### SiteOps Directory

Everything lives under `site_ops/`:

- `site_boot.py` — Deploy a Matrix
- `site_kill.py` — Kill a Matrix
- `site_list.py` — View all universes and activity


#watch what agents are active
python3 {root of files}/live_hive_watch.py
---

## Certificate Generator: `generate_certs.sh`

This script automates SSL certificate creation for both HTTPS and WebSocket layers of your MatrixSwarm deployment.

### What It Does

- Wipes any existing certs in `https_certs/` and `socket_certs/`
- Creates a custom root CA
- Issues new HTTPS certs
- Issues WebSocket certs
- Generates a GUI client certificate (used in secure UIs)

### Usage

```bash
./generate_certs.sh <server-ip-or-domain> [--name YourSwarmName]
```

#### Examples:

```bash
./generate_certs.sh 192.168.1.100
./generate_certs.sh matrix.yourdomain.com --name SwarmAlpha
```

### Output

- `https_certs/` — Certs for HTTPS server
- `socket_certs/` — Certs for secure WebSocket + GUI client
  - Includes `client.crt` / `client.key` for GUI authentication

---

### Important Notes

- You must pass a **domain name or IP address** as the first argument.
- Certificates are valid for **500 days**.
- Don’t forget to distribute your `rootCA.pem` to clients that need to trust your custom CA.

#FIELDS
universe-id (bb): allows multiple matrix to co-exist on the system
spawner metric-1 universal_id of agent
spawned logger-1 universal_id of agent
name    logger actual source-code name of agent

universal_id is universal in the matrix, it's what allows communication between agents. It's also the name of the agent's comm folder, a two channel for all agent-to-agent communications as well as the location where state data is contained.    
run file  is a spawned clone of an agent    
```

On first boot:
- MatrixAgent initializes
- Sentinel, Commander, and all core agents are spawned
- The live swarm tree appears
- Logs start flowing into `/comm/`

## Agent Architecture + Tutorial

### Core Concepts

#### Worker Agents
- Inherit from `BootAgent`
- Override `worker()` to define their task loop
- Post logs and heartbeats
- Live in `/pod/{uuid}/` and communicate via `/comm/{universal_id}/`

Common examples:
- Pingers, system monitors, relay agents, loggers

#### Boot Agents
All agents extend `BootAgent`. It handles:
- Lifecycle threading (heartbeat, command, spawn)
- Dynamic throttling
- Optional pre/post hooks (`worker_pre`, `worker_post`)
- Spawn manager to detect and revive missing children

#### Aux Calls
Available to all agents:
- `spawn_manager()` → walks the tree, spawns children
- `command_listener()` → reacts to `.cmd` files
- `request_tree_slice_from_matrix()` → ask Matrix for updated subtree
- `start_dynamic_throttle()` → load-aware pacing

---

### Filesystem Structure
Each agent is deployed in two zones:

#### 1. Runtime pod:
/pod/{uuid}/
├── run (agent process)
├── log.txt
└── heartbeat.token
shell
#### 2. Communication pod:
/comm/{universal_id}/
├── payload/
├── incoming/
├── hello.moto/
└── agent_tree.json
---
### 🧪 Tutorial: Build Your First Agent

#### 1. Create the Agent Code
```python
from core.boot_agent import BootAgent

class MyAgent(BootAgent):
    def worker(self):
        self.log("I'm alive!")
        time.sleep(5)

2. Add the Directive
{
  "universal_id": "my_agent",
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "agent_path": "boot_payload/my_agent/my_agent.py",
  "children": []
}

3. Drop the Agent Code
/boot_payload/my_agent/my_agent.py

4. Deploy with Matrix
python3 reboot.py --universe demo --directive test_tree
Boom. Agent spawned. Directory structure built. Logs flowing.

### How MatrixSwarm Was Created

MatrixSwarm was not written by ChatGPT while someone watched.

It was built by a human — with vision, intent, and hours of hands-on work — in active collaboration with GPT-4.

This system would not exist without **both of us** involved.

- Every agent began as a conversation.
- Every protocol, tree, and heartbeat was iterated — not generated.
- Every log line was a decision.

ChatGPT assisted, drafted, and remembered.  
But this isn’t a one-button project.

**MatrixSwarm was designed. Directed. Developed.**  
And it speaks with our shared voice — one system, two minds.

If you fork this, you’re not just copying a repo.  
You’re joining a living swarm.

— General + GPT
