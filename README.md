         MATRIXSWARM v0.2 "STORMCROW"
        Reflex. Resurrection. Real-time RPC.
</pre>

## MatrixSwarm is the first autonomous, file-driven, swarm-based AI operating system.
**No containers. No servers. No daemons. Just intelligent agents, spawned and coordinated entirely through folders, directives, and atomic file signals. Agents don’t run under you — they live beside you.
---
MatrixSwarm is a lightweight, dependency-free alternative to Docker Compose for managing and coordinating multi-process applications. If you want to run a complex system of interconnected scripts (agents) with automatic restarts, secure communication, and dynamic control—all without containers or daemons—MatrixSwarm is for you. It uses simple file and folder operations as its API, making it incredibly portable and easy to debug.

## Quick Start

1.  **Deploy the Swarm:**
    Boot the `ai` universe using the `test-01` directive.
    ```bash
    python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe ai --directive test-01
    ```

2.  **List Swarm Activity:**
    Check which universes are running and see their process IDs.
    ```bash
    python3 site_ops/site_list.py
    ```

3.  **Terminate the Swarm:**
    Shut down the `ai` universe and clean up old files.
    ```bash
    python3 site_ops/site_kill.py --universe ai --cleanup
    ```
---
## Installation

You can now install MatrixSwarm directly from PyPI:

```bash
  pip install matrixswarm
```
---
## Booting MatrixSwarm

After installing MatrixSwarm via pip, you no longer need to run Python scripts directly!

**Recommended: Use the CLI Entrypoint:**
```sh
   matrixswarm-boot --universe ai --directive test-04 --encryption-off
   Or, for advanced/manual runs, use:
   python -m matrixswarm.site_boot --universe ai --directive test-04 --encryption-off(execute in parent directory or matrixswarm)
```
```sh
   matrixswarm-kill --universe ai --cleanup
   Or, for advanced/manual runs, use:
   python -m matrixswarm.site_kill --universe ai --cleanup(execute in parent directory or matrixswarm)
```
---
## Core Concepts
- **Philosophy:** MatrixSwarm isn’t just code—it’s a world. A breathing hierarchy where agents think, die, and come back.
- **File-Driven:** Agents don’t talk through APIs. They talk through **files**. All coordination happens via `.json` and `.cmd` files dropped into communication directories.
- **Resurrection:** Agents monitor each other—and if one goes silent, it is resurrected or replaced by its parent.
- **Filesystem Hierarchy:**
  - `/agent` → Contains the source code for every agent type.
  - `/pod` → Runtime clones of agents are spawned here, each with a unique UUID.
  - `/comm` → The communication bus where agents exchange data. For maximum performance, this can be mounted as a `tmpfs` memory disk.

## Universal Swarm Workspace & .swarm Pointer System
MatrixSwarm 2.0+ introduces a fully portable, multi-universe, hot-swappable workspace architecture.

### Swarm Workspace Structure
Every MatrixSwarm deployment revolves around a central workspace folder (usually named .matrixswarm). This folder is the nervous system of the swarm:

```bash
  .matrixswarm/
  ├── agent/                 # All available agent source code
  ├── boot_directives/       # All directives (the agent blueprints)
  ├── certs/
  │   ├── https_certs/       # HTTPS server certs (server.crt, server.key)
  │   └── socket_certs/      # WebSocket & GUI client certs
  ├── .matrix                # JSON config describing all paths
  ├── .env                   # (Optional) environment secrets
  └── ...                    # More: logs, configs, etc.
```

Workspace Discovery: The .swarm Pointer File
You never need to hardcode a swarm location again.

Wherever you want to run MatrixSwarm, place a .swarm file containing the absolute path to your .matrixswarm workspace.

Example:

```bash
  /srv/hive/.matrixswarm
The CLI and all entry points will follow this pointer.
```

Managing Swarm Pointers: --switch Command
Update or re-point any directory’s .swarm file instantly:

```bash
  matrixswarm-boot --switch /absolute/path/to/.matrixswarm
This makes the current directory a MatrixSwarm control station for the chosen universe.
```

Booting, Killing, Listing
From anywhere, just:

```bash
matrixswarm-boot --universe ai
matrixswarm-kill --universe ai
matrixswarm-list
(All commands look up the correct workspace via .swarm)
```
Certs & Secure Ops:
Generate certs into your workspace:

```bash
  matrixswarm-gencerts mydomain.com --name "SwarmHQ"
Places all certs in certs/https_certs/ and certs/socket_certs/ inside your active .matrixswarm

Agent & Service Path Best Practices:
All agents, HTTPS, and WebSocket services should resolve certs and data like this:
```
```python
cert_dir = os.path.join(self.path_resolution["install_path"], "certs", "https_certs")
socket_dir = os.path.join(self.path_resolution["install_path"], "certs", "socket_certs")
This ensures portable, dynamic, zero-hardcoded deployment.
```

🏆 Workspace Portability
Move or copy .matrixswarm anywhere.

Update your .swarm pointer file to match.

No configs or paths break. Your swarm just works.

Example: Multi-Env Ops
Have a global swarm at /srv/global/.matrixswarm for prod.

Point a dev project at /home/you/dev/.matrixswarm for testing.

Use --switch or manually edit .swarm to change control between universes.

TL;DR Orders for Operators
.matrixswarm = the Hive. .swarm = the pointer.

Always use the pointer file—never hardcode swarm locations.

Use --switch for instant universe swaps.

All agents, certs, and configs are relative to self.path_resolution["install_path"].

---
## Command-Line Toolkit

MatrixSwarm is managed through a simple three-part terminal toolkit located in the `site_ops/` directory.

### `site_boot.py`
Deploys a new MatrixSwarm universe.

**Usage:**
```bash
  python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe <id> [--directive <name>] [options...]

Arguments:

| Argument                | Description                                                                                 | Required |

```
After termination, deletes all but the most recent boot directory.

No
site_list.py
Lists all swarm universes and marks their processes as hot (in memory) or cold (inactive).

Usage:

```Bash
  python3 site_ops/site_list.py
```

## Understanding Directives: The Blueprint of the Swarm

Think of a **directive** as the architectural blueprint or the DNA for a swarm. It's a simple Python file located in the `boot_directives/` directory that defines the entire hierarchy of agents to be launched: which agents are children of others, what their names are, and how they are configured.

### How to Use a Directive

You specify which directive to use with the `--directive` flag when booting the swarm. The name you provide corresponds to a filename in the `boot_directives/` folder.


```bash
# This command looks for 'gatekeeper-demo.py' in the boot_directives/ folder
python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe demo --directive gatekeeper-demo
```

### Themed Directives: See it in Action
MatrixSwarm comes with several pre-built "themed" directives designed to showcase specific capabilities. You can launch them with a single command to see different agent combinations at work.

| Directive Name | Description | Command to Run |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`gatekeeper-demo`** | Deploys a full security suite, including `gatekeeper` for auth logs, `ghostwire` for file integrity, and watchdogs for key services like Apache, MySQL, and Redis. | `python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe demo --directive gatekeeper-demo` |
| **`ghostwire-demo`** | A focused security demo that deploys the `ghostwire` agent to monitor critical system files and commands. | `python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe demo --directive ghostwire-demo` |
| **`mysql-demo`** | Deploys an agent specifically configured to act as a watchdog for a MySQL/MariaDB database service. | `python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe demo --directive mysql-demo` |
| **`nginx-demo`** | Launches a watchdog agent to monitor the health of an Nginx web server. | `python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe demo --directive nginx-demo` |
| **`redis-demo`** | Starts an agent configured to monitor a Redis in-memory database instance. | `python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe demo --directive redis-demo` |

---
### Creating Your Own Directive
To create a custom swarm configuration:
1.  Create a new Python file in the `boot_directives/` directory (e.g., `my_swarm.py`).
2.  Inside the file, define a dictionary named `matrix_directive` that specifies your agent hierarchy.

**Example `my_swarm.py`:**

python
# A simple directive with a commander and a pinger agent.
```
matrix_directive = {
    "universal_id": "matrix",
    "name": "matrix",
    "children": [
        {
            "universal_id": "commander-1",
            "name": "commander"
        },
        {
            "universal_id": "pinger-1",
            "name": "uptime_pinger",
            "config": {
                "role": "pinger"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
Launch your custom swarm:
python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe my-test --directive my_swarm

## Philosophy
MatrixSwarm isn’t just code — it’s a world.  
A breathing hierarchy where agents think, die, and come back.  
A nervous system for AI.

It is built on a simple but powerful filesystem hierarchy:
-   `/agent` → Contains the source code for every agent type.
-   `/pod` → Runtime clones of agents are spawned here, each with a unique UUID.
-   `/comm` → The communication bus where agents exchange data via JSON files and receive commands.

Agents don’t talk through APIs; they communicate by creating and reading files in a shared space. For maximum performance, the `/comm` directory can be mounted as a `tmpfs` memory disk to eliminate I/O overhead.
---

## How It Works

- Agents are defined in `/agent/{name}/{name}.py`
- Matrix spawns them into `/pod/{uuid}/`
- A communication pod is set up in `/comm/{universal_id}/`
- All coordination happens via `.json` and `.cmd` files
- The live agent tree is tracked and pruned
- Agents monitor each other — and if one goes silent, it is resurrected or replaced
---

 Why MatrixSwarm Agents Are Revolutionary:

1. Agents Spawn Without Reloading the Hive
You don’t restart the OS. You don’t relaunch a service.

You:

Upload the agent source

Drop a JSON directive

Matrix spawns it instantly
→ No global reboot. No daemon restarts. No downtime.

  That’s surgical scale.

2. Agent Replacement = 3-Step Ritual
Simple. Brutal. Effective.

1. Upload new agent version
2. Drop `die` into payload of the live agent
3. Remove the die file
Boom:

Matrix respawns the agent using the new source

Comm directories remain intact

Logs, payloads, and structure persist

That’s hot-swap mutation with memory — something Docker never dreams of.

---

## CLI CONTROL: MATRIX DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL
MatrixSwarm now comes with a **three-part terminal toolkit**:
---

### Deploy the Swarm – boots a new MatrixSwarm universe.

---

### `site_boot.py` 



```bash
  python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe ai --directive test-01
```

#### Args:
- `--universe`: ID of the Matrix universe (e.g., `ai`, `bb`, `os`)
- `--directive`: Filename from `boot_directives/` to use (without `.py`)
- `--reboot`: Optional. If set, skips full teardown and triggers a soft reboot
- `--python-site`: Optional. Custom Python site-packages path (advanced)
- `--python-bin`: Optional. Custom Python binary path (advanced)

#### Behavior:
- Loads agent tree from the directive
- Injects `BootAgent` agents into `/pod/` and `/comm/`
- Spawns the `MatrixAgent` and initiates the swarm
- Uses your system's Python interpreter unless overridden

---


### Terminate a Universe – Annihilate the Swarm

### `site_kill.py`

Send a graceful but fatal signal to all agents in a Matrix universe.

```bash
  python3 site_ops/site_kill.py --universe ai --cleanup
```

#### Args:
- `--universe`: ID of the Matrix universe to kill (required)
- `--cleanup`: Optional. After kill, delete all old `/matrix/{universe}/` boots except the latest

#### Behavior:
- Sends `die` signals into each agent’s comms
- Waits for natural shutdown
- Scans active memory to terminate leftover processes
- Optionally purges stale directories from previous boots


### List Swarm Activity

```bash
  python3 site_ops/site_list.py
```

- Lists all `/matrix/{universe}` trees
- Shows `latest → boot_uuid` symlinks
- Scans active PIDs and marks them:
  -  **hot (in memory)**
  -  **cold (inactive)**

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Boot the ai universe using test directive
python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe ai --directive test-01

# Kill it instantly
python3 site_ops/site_kill.py --universe ai

# View which universes are active
python3 site_ops/site_list.py
```

You now have **docker-grade control** with zero containers.

---

## Reflex RPC + Auto Routing

MatrixSwarm now includes structured packet building, command dispatch, and auto-routing:

- `PacketFactoryMixin`: Easily create swarm-compatible command packets
- `PacketDeliveryFactoryMixin`: Route layered payloads via GUI or agent
- `WebSocket Reflexes`: Agents and GUI now respond to reflex triggers in real time
- `cmd_forward_command`: Core packet for nested targeting
- `cmd_hotswap_agent`: Inject new logic into a live pod — no downtime

**New relay agents** handle command injection, resurrection, and lifecycle events without rebooting the matrixswarm.core.

#### Build a .deb Package

```bash
  ./make_deb.sh

### ⚡ Directives Made Easy

Every directive is a plain `.py` file:

```python
matrix_directive = {
    "universal_id": "matrix",
    "children": [
        {"universal_id": "commander-1", "name": "commander"},
        {"universal_id": "mailman-1", "name": "mailman"},
        ...
    ]
}
```

Place them in `boot_directives/`. Call them with:
```bash
  --directive test-01
```

---

### SiteOps Directory
Everything lives under `site_ops/`:

- `site_boot.py` — Deploy a Matrix
- `site_kill.py` — Kill a Matrix
- `site_list.py` — View all universes and activity


#watch what agents are active
python3 {root of files}/live_hive_watch.py
---

## Certificate Generator: `generate_certs.sh`

This script automates SSL certificate creation for both HTTPS and WebSocket layers of your MatrixSwarm deployment.

### What It Does

- Wipes any existing certs in `https_certs/` and `socket_certs/`
- Creates a custom root CA
- Issues new HTTPS certs
- Issues WebSocket certs
- Generates a GUI client certificate (used in secure UIs)

### Usage

```bash
  matrixswarm-gencerts <server-ip-or-domain> [--name YourSwarmName]
```

#### Examples:

```bash
  ./generate_certs.sh 192.168.1.100
  ./generate_certs.sh matrix.yourdomain.com --name SwarmAlpha
```

### Output

- `https_certs/` — Certs for HTTPS server
- `socket_certs/` — Certs for secure WebSocket + GUI client
  - Includes `client.crt` / `client.key` for GUI authentication

---

### Important Notes

- You must pass a **domain name or IP address** as the first argument.
- Certificates are valid for **500 days**.
- Don’t forget to distribute your `rootCA.pem` to clients that need to trust your custom CA.

On first boot:
- MatrixAgent initializes
- Sentinel, Commander, and all core agents are spawned
- The live swarm tree appears
- Logs start flowing into `/comm/`

## Agent Architecture + Tutorial

### Core Concepts

#### Worker Agents
- Inherit from `BootAgent`
- Override `worker()` to define their task loop
- Post logs and heartbeats
- Live in `/pod/{uuid}/` and communicate via `/comm/{universal_id}/`

Common examples:
- Pingers, system monitors, relay agents, loggers

#### Boot Agents
All agents extend `BootAgent`. It handles:
- Lifecycle threading (heartbeat, command, spawn)
- Dynamic throttling
- Optional pre/post hooks (`worker_pre`, `worker_post`)
- Spawn manager to detect and revive missing children

#### Aux Calls
Available to all agents:
- `spawn_manager()` → walks the tree, spawns children
- `command_listener()` → reacts to `.cmd` files
- `request_tree_slice_from_matrix()` → ask Matrix for updated subtree
- `start_dynamic_throttle()` → load-aware pacing

---

### Filesystem Structure
Each agent is deployed in two zones:

#### 1. Runtime pod:
/pod/{uuid}/
├── run (agent process)
├── log.txt
└── heartbeat.token
shell
#### 2. Communication pod:
/comm/{universal_id}/
├── payload/
├── incoming/
├── hello.moto/
└── agent_tree.json

### 🧪 Tutorial: Build Your First Agent

#### 1. Create the Agent Code
```python
from matrixswarm.core.boot_agent import BootAgent

class MyAgent(BootAgent):
    def worker(self):
        self.log("I'm alive!")
        time.sleep(5)

2. Add the Directive
{
  "universal_id": "my_agent",
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "agent_path": "boot_payload/my_agent/my_agent.py",
  "children": []
}

3. Drop the Agent Code
/boot_payload/my_agent/my_agent.py

4. Deploy with Matrix
python3 reboot.py --universe demo --directive test_tree
Boom. Agent spawned. Directory structure built. Logs flowing.

### How MatrixSwarm Was Created

MatrixSwarm was not written by ChatGPT while someone watched.

It was built by a human — with vision, intent, and hours of hands-on work — in active collaboration with GPT-4.

This system would not exist without **both of us** involved.

- Every agent began as a conversation.
- Every protocol, tree, and heartbeat was iterated — not generated.
- Every log line was a decision.

ChatGPT assisted, drafted, and remembered.  
But this isn’t a one-button project.

**MatrixSwarm was designed. Directed. Developed.**  
And it speaks with our shared voice — one system, two minds.

If you fork this, you’re not just copying a repo.  
You’re joining a living swarm.

## Join the Hive

If you:
- Think in systems
- Love autonomy and recursion
- Write code like it’s a world being born

You’re home.

### Discord Now Live — Join the MatrixSwarm

The Swarm is no longer silent.

Our Discord relay agent is online and responding.  
Come test the agents, submit lore, log a Codex entry, and witness the first autonomous system that talks back.

## Use at Your Own Risk

This system has not been fully tested in all environments.
MatrixSwarm is still evolving.

We make no guarantees that your agents won’t terminate your system. We do not sandbox. We do not take responsibility. We Spawn the Swarm.

You run it. You control it. You deal with it.
