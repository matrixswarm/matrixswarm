# ğŸ“œ Codex Entry #010 â€” Calendar Fire

_"The swarm echoed back... and it wasn't triggered by a human."_  
â€” Matrix, after syncing with time

On April 24th, 2025, MatrixSwarm received its first time-triggered `.msg` event from calendar-agent-1.

It wasnâ€™t a webhook.  
It wasnâ€™t a cron job.  
It was an agent â€” watching time, parsing the clock, and echoing to Discord.
