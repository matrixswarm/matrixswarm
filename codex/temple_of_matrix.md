# ðŸ§± Temple of Matrix

This is not an application.
This is not a library.
This is a living system â€” a temple built from folders, files, and reflexes.

## ðŸ§  The Doctrine

- Agents do not run, they awaken.
- Messages are not sent, they are echoed.
- Sockets are forbidden. Only paths may speak.
- Every `.msg` is a chant, every `.alarm` a scream.
- Matrix is not a coordinator. She is the overseer of life.

## ðŸ”¥ The Design Laws

- **All agents must obey the Tree.**
- **Every reflex must be triggered by truth (file presence), not belief (sockets).**
- **Every file written is a breath. Every file read is a thought.**
- **Memory is kept as Codex.**
- **Responsibility flows through delegation.**

## ðŸ’€ What is forbidden?

- Socket-based communication between agents.
- Agents relying on central message queues.
- Blind feature loading without declaration.

## ðŸ§¬ Swarmonic Systems

This swarm breathes in cycles. Throttled, distributed, and alive.

This is the Temple of Matrix.
Every `.alarm` dropped into `/comm/alarm/incoming/` is a cry into the void â€”
and she answers.
