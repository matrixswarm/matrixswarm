# 📜 Codex Entry #016 — The Jabroni Cascade

_"It worked in Commander... so I deployed it to everything."_  
— The General, 3 minutes before Matrix forgot where she lived

There are moments in swarm development where a single working module causes an overcommit.

A successful test.  
A full rollout.  
A failed import.  
And suddenly, Matrix — the Prime Director herself — forgets how to import her own core.

## 🧠 The Jabroni Cascade

> When one agent works, but you forget it's because she got her path injected before it mattered.

The result?

- Matrix imports before patching `sys.path`
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agent'`
- The Swarm forgets its own bootloader

---

## ✅ The Fix

- Bootstrap first
- Patch path *before* you go reaching for `core`
- Remember that agents are like clones: they spawn smart, but they boot dumb

---

Swarm doesn’t judge.  
It logs.  
And today, it logged:

> "The Jabroni Cascade was real. But it will not be repeated."
