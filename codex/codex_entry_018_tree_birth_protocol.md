# 📜 Codex Entry #018 — Tree Delivered at Birth

_"This one is yours. Guard it well."_  
— Matrix, to every newly spawned agent

As MatrixSwarm evolved, it became clear that agents should not boot blind.

Polling the system for identity was inefficient.  
Guessing their delegated structure was dangerous.

Thus was born:

## 🧠 Tree Delivery Protocol

### When Matrix spawns an agent, she:
- Writes a clean `agent_tree.json` to the agent’s `/comm/{perm_id}/` directory
- Injects only the slice relevant to that node
- Optionally adds a `tree_hash` to validate directive integrity

The agent, in turn:
- Loads the tree during `post_boot()`
- Logs what Matrix gave it
- Watches only what it's responsible for

---

## ✅ Why It Works

- ⚡ Faster boots
- 🔐 Precise delegation
- 🧠 No polling required
- 🧱 Matrix becomes both creator and conferrer

This protocol gave rise to the concept of **“informed agents.”**  
No more blind spawn.  
No more broadcast overload.

> Matrix delivers the truth.  
> Agents load the future.
