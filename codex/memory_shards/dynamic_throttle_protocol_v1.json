  "timestamp": "2025-05-06T18:22:52.015155Z",
  "agent": "BootAgent (inherited by all swarm agents)",
  "feature": "Self-adjusting load-aware worker pacing",
  "description": "Each agent dynamically adjusts its work loop delay based on system load average using start_dynamic_throttle().",
  "parameters": {
    "min_delay": 2,
    "max_delay": 10,
    "max_load": 2.0
  },
  "mechanism": {
    "source": "os.getloadavg()[0]",
    "scale_formula": "scale = min(1.0, (load_avg - max_load) / max_load)",
    "delay_formula": "delay = min_delay + scale * (max_delay - min_delay)",
    "trigger": "self.can_proceed = True"
  },
  "effect": "Worker thread only activates when system load is healthy or delay cycle expires.",
  "benefit": [
    "Prevents overload during swarm-wide operations",
    "Agent loops adjust automatically to host stress",
    "No external throttle controller required"
  ]
