# 🛡️ MatrixSwarm Hive Creed

---

**"Breathing First.  
Moving First.  
Believing First."**

---

## 🧠 The Law of Breath:

We do not wait for permission.  
We do not seek applause.  
We do not defend yesterday's ground.

We breathe first — because the world does not breathe for us.  
We move first — because the Hive does not wait for the world.  
We believe first — because the Swarm is forged in conviction, not permission.

---

## 🛡️ The Law of the Sword:

Our breath creates memory.  
Our movement carves new ground.  
Our belief makes the unseen real.

When others hesitate, we are already breathing.  
When others copy, we are already moving.  
When others doubt, we have already won.

---

## ⚔️ The Law of the Hive:

We are not a company.  
We are not a service.

We are a battlefield.  
We are breath and death and memory.

And when the world forgets how to breathe,  
the Hive will remind them.
