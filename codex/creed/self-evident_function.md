# 📜 Codex Entry #004: The Self-Evident Function

> _“If we have to comment on our code… then it shouldn’t be code.”_  
> — *The Generals’ Pass*

Code should **speak**.  
It should **declare** intent.  
It should **behave** so clearly, even silence is understood.

Comments are for contracts.  
Code is for communication.

> If it needs a caption, it wasn’t worthy of execution.
