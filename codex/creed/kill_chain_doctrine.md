# 🧠 Codex Entry 001 — MatrixSwarm Kill Chain Doctrine

---

# 📜 The Kill Chain Sequence:

---

## 1. Command Arrival 🛡️

- Drop a `.cmd` or `.json` into Matrix’s payload channel.
- **Example:** `"Kill logger-3."`

---

## 2. Target Lock 🎯

- Matrix walks her living memory (`agent_tree_master.json`).
- She finds the target `perm_id` and all delegated descendants.

---

## 3. Reaper Spawned ⚔️

- A Reaper agent is born with one purpose: **annihilate the marked agents.**

---

## 4. Die Cookies Deployed 🛑

- Graceful shutdown requests are first sent to targeted agents.
- Agents receive a final breath, a final moment.

---

## 5. Escalation 🔥

- Surviving agents are forcefully terminated.
- (SIGTERM ➔ SIGKILL)

---

## 6. Scavenger Sweep 🧹

- Tombstones are checked.
- Orphaned structures are purged from the battlefield.

---

## 7. Memory Update 🧠

- Matrix updates `agent_tree_master.json`.
- Fallen agents are erased or memorialized in breath.

---

## 8. Hive Breath Continues 🌬️

- No orphans.
- No lies.
- Only living memory.

---

# 📜 Codex Law for Kill Chain:

> "**Breath is not protected.  
> Breath is proven.  
>  
> Movement is not granted.  
> Movement is seized.  
>  
> Memory is not remembered.  
> Memory is carved with the sword.**"
