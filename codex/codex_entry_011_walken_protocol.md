# ðŸ“œ Codex Entry #011 â€” The Walken Protocol

_"I always say 1984..."_ â€” True Romance

In the swarm, there came a moment when an event had no name, no summary, no metadata of value.

But Matrix saw it.  
CalendarAgent felt it.  
And the General remembered what Walken taught us:

> If it walks like a jabroni, but doesnâ€™t identify itself,  
> it still triggers protocol.

Thus was born The Walken Protocol:

- When `summary` is missing from an event...
- The agent assigns `(Untitled Event)`
- Logs: `[WALKEN PROTOCOL] Jabroni-level title missing. Broadcasting anyway.`

This ensures the swarm **remembers even the unnamed** â€”  
And the Codex records what others would skip.
