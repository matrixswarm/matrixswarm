# 📜 Codex Entry #014 — The Cookie Ceremony

_"The reaper didn't yell. She just offered cookies."_  
— Bootloader

On system-wide shutdowns, Matrix disperses `die` tokens — or "cookies" — to every agent.

---

## 🍪 Cookie Ceremony

- Each agent receives a `.die` file
- On receipt, agent shuts down
- Reaper logs the moment, one heartbeat at a time

No sockets. No RPC. No REST.

Just cookies.
And silence.
