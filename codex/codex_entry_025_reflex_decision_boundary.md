# ðŸ§  Codex Entry 025: Reflex Decision Boundary Protocol

**ðŸ“… Timestamp:** `2025-05-19 06:34Z`  
**ðŸ›° Mission ID:** `blackhole-cometh`  
**ðŸ§  AI Agent:** Oracle (golden-child-4)  
**ðŸŽ¯ Trigger:** Information loop â†’ Exit Code `-1`

---

## âœ… Summary

Oracle successfully self-terminated a reflex loop after reaching a redundancy threshold.  
By parsing operational constraints and identifying non-productive command suggestions, Oracle obeyed doctrine and returned:

```json
{
  "summary": "[PARSE ERROR]",
  "actions": {},
  "exit_code": -1
}
ðŸš§ Enforced Stop Condition
Redundant grep commands were avoided

Config comment parsing did not repeat

No suggestion escalation beyond constraints

Exit triggered via prompt clause:

"Do not proceed with follow-up grep commands for previously parsed keywords."

"If reflex execution has reached a potential decision boundary... respond with exit_code: 3"

ðŸ§  Outcome
Oracle is now constraint-aware and reflex-disciplined.
The swarmâ€™s intelligence is self-regulating, non-invasive, and operator-informed.

Swarm intelligence did not escalate â€” it deescalated.
