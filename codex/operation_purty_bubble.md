# 🧠⚔️ OPERATION PURTY BUBBLE

**Codex Entry:** `codex.trust.0147`
**Author:** MatrixSwarm Commander (Verified)

## 🧬 Summary

Operation Purty Bubble defines the **encrypted directive launch protocol** for MatrixSwarm deployments.
It allows agents to **boot from sealed `.enc` files** using a **swarm-synchronized AES-GCM key**.

No plaintext directives touch disk.
Trust is verified. Integrity is enforced.

> 🔐 *Decrypt on command. Boot in trust. Live in the swarm.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Ensure confidential swarm mission planning
- Protect agent directives at rest and in transit
- Eliminate reliance on unsealed JSON directives
- Enforce single-source trust boot via shared swarm key

---

## 🧱 Encrypted Directive Format

An AES-GCM envelope, stored as JSON:

```json
{
  "nonce": "<base64>",
  "tag": "<base64>",
  "ciphertext": "<base64>"
}
The payload is a sealed matrix_directive, SHA256-verified and decrypted in memory only.

🛠️ Boot Protocol
bash
Copy
Edit
python site_boot.py \
  --universe ai \
  --encrypted_directive /matrix_sealed/matrix.enc \
  --swarm_key AbCdEf123...==
Boot behavior:

Matrix decrypts .enc with AES-GCM using --swarm_key

Payload SHA256 hash is validated

Spawn proceeds via vault injection

tree_node remains clean of trust material

All agents inherit the encrypted trust chain

🔐 Integrity Enforcement
Required at spawn:

pub / priv keypair

swarm_key

matrix_pub

matrix_priv (real or fallback)

Valid SHA256 envelope signature

If any field is missing, spawn is terminated with prejudice.
